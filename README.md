# Fascism Development Tracker

Fascism is not a word to be taken lightly. It must not be used as a placeholder for "person I don't like" or "policy I disagree with." It is a specific accusation of a mass political movement centered around extreme nationalism, militarism, and the placement of national interests above those of the individual. Contributors of this repository are expected to denounce illiberal ideologies such as fascism or leftism, and should support the ideals of liberalism including liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, private property, free trade, individual civil rights, and freedom of speech.

The table below outlines 14 characteristics commonly associated with fascist regimes. It is important to note that the presence of any single characteristic does not, in isolation, define a political system as fascist. For instance, national pride is not inherently fascistic and contributors should indeed be proud Americans; however, when patriotic sentiment is dictatoraly enforced or is combined with other elements, such as the suppression of human rights, control over the mass media, and the intertwining of religion with state power, the cumulative effect can lead to a fascistic regime. In essence, it is the aggregation of these tendencies, rather than any one feature alone, that may signal the emergence or existence of fascism.

| No. | Characteristic                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**         | Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are ubiquitous, and flag symbols appear on clothing and in public displays.                                                                                                                                      |
| 2   | **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** | Owing to a pervasive fear of enemies and a preoccupation with security, fascist regimes promote the idea that human rights can be set aside in certain circumstances. This often leads to public acquiescence or even approval of torture, summary executions, assassinations, prolonged incarcerations, and other human rights abuses. |
| 3   | **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats**        | The populace is rallied into a unifying patriotic fervor by designating a perceived common enemy—such as racial, ethnic, or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists; or terrorists—as the target for elimination.                                                                                                        |
| 4   | **Supremacy of the Military**                   | Despite prevalent domestic issues, the military is often allocated disproportionate funding, and domestic priorities are neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized as embodiments of national strength.                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Rampant Sexism**                              | Fascist governments are typically dominated by males, enforcing rigid traditional gender roles. There is strong opposition to abortion, and policies are often characterized by homophobia and anti-gay legislation.                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | **Controlled Mass Media**                       | Media control is either direct—through government ownership—or indirect, via regulation and the influence of sympathetic media figures. Censorship is common, particularly during times of conflict.                                                                                                                                    |
| 7   | **Obsession with National Security**            | The government utilizes fear as a tool to mobilize and control the population, emphasizing a constant state of emergency or threat to national security.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8   | **Religion and Government are Intertwined**     | The dominant religion of a nation is exploited as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Government leaders frequently employ religious rhetoric—even when the core tenets of that religion conflict with governmental policies—to justify their actions.                                                                                 |
| 9   | **Corporate Power is Protected**                | The industrial and business elite are often instrumental in bringing fascist leaders to power. In return, these leaders foster a mutually beneficial relationship with these elites, creating a protective power structure that safeguards corporate interests.                                                                         |
| 10  | **Labor Power is Suppressed**                   | Labor unions and the collective power of organized labor are viewed as threats. Consequently, labor unions are either entirely dismantled or heavily repressed under fascist regimes.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11  | **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**      | Fascist regimes commonly display overt hostility toward higher education and academia, with professors and academics sometimes facing censorship or arrest. Similarly, artistic expression is curtailed, and state funding for the arts is often withheld or manipulated to serve ideological ends.                                     |
| 12  | **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**         | Under fascist regimes, the police are endowed with near-unlimited authority to enforce laws. The public is often willing to overlook abuses or sacrifice civil liberties in the name of patriotism, and a national police force with extensive powers is a common feature.                                                              |
| 13  | **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**             | Leadership is frequently concentrated among groups of friends and associates who appoint one another to government positions, thereby protecting their network from accountability. It is not uncommon for national resources—and even treasures—to be misappropriated or outright stolen by those in power.                            |
| 14  | **Fraudulent Elections**                        | Elections under fascist regimes are often manipulated or entirely fabricated. Tactics may include smear campaigns, the assassination of opposition figures, legislative manipulation to control voting demographics or district boundaries, and the use of judicial power to influence electoral outcomes.                              |

| **Description**       | After the first mid-air collision in US air space in over 16 years on Jan 29th, 2025, president Trump immediately placed the blame on DEI hiring practices, prior to any initial investigation. Two pilot names were provided within 24 hours (Chief Warrant Officer Andrew Eaves and Staff Sergeant Ryan O'Hara). At the request of the family, the US Army withheld the identification of the 3rd pilot. This is widely believed to be caused by the discourse surrounding DEI and the sex of the 3rd pilot being female. The family did not want her name associated with hiring malpractice and used as political fodder. |
